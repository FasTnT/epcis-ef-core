# [EPCIS](https://fastnt.github.io/)
EF Core version of EPCIS repository

FasTnT EPCIS is a lightweight GS1 EPCIS 1.2 repository written in C# using .NET 6 and backed using EntityFramework Core.

There is a [sandbox](https://fastnt.github.io/sandbox.html) available if you want to quickly test this repository capabilities.

## Setup

Prerequisites:
- SQL Server 2016 or +
- .NET 6 SDK

Steps:
1. Download the source code, and create a new user/database in SQL Server for FasTnT ;
2. Start the repository with the command `$ dotnet run -p FasTnT.Host\FasTnT.Host.csproj --urls "http://localhost:5102/" --connectionStrings:FasTnT.Database "{your connectionstring}"` ;

That's it! You have a properly working EPCIS 1.2 repository.

You can also setup FasTnT EPCIS using the Docker image or in Azure quite easily. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/FasTnT/epcis-ef-core/wiki/Installation) for more details.

## HTTP Endpoints

### EPCIS 1.2 endpoints:

The API is secured using HTTP Basic authentication. There is no default user, but when in Development environment the unknown users will be created autmatically. A user is limited to see only the events and masterdata he captured by default.

- Capture: `POST /v1_2/Capture`
- Queries : `POST /v1_2/Query.svc`

**Capture** endpoint only supports requests with `content-type: application/xml` or `content-type: text/xml` header and XML payload.

**Queries** endpoint supports SOAP requests on endpoint `/v1_2/Query.svc`.
